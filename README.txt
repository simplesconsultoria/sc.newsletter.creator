Overview
--------

It was the dawn of the third age of mankind - ten years after the Earth-Minbari 
War.

The Babylon Project was a dream, given form. Its goal: to prevent another war, 
by creating a place where humans and aliens can work out their differences 
peacefully. It's a port of call - home away from home - for diplomats, hustlers, 
entrepreneurs, and wanderers.

Humans and aliens, wrapped in two million, five hundred thousand tons of 
spinning metal . . . all alone in the night.

It can be a dangerous place, but it's our last best hope for peace.

This is the story of the last of the Babylon stations
